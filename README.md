                                 **Using Data analysis to unmask the thrills of the English Premier League 2021-22 Season**
                                 
Over the weekend, I came across this dataset on Kaggle named: “ EPL ⚽ 2021-22 ⭐  English Premier League “. It included three CSV files: "all_match_results.csv," "all_players_stats.csv," and "points_table.csv." You can find the dataset here: “https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/azminetoushikwasi/epl-21-22-matches-players.” Curiosity got the best of me, so I decided to dive in and see what I could uncover about the English Premier League 2021-22 season.
After analyzing the dataset The English Premier League (EPL) 2021-22 season was nothing short of a rollercoaster ride, filled with moments of sheer brilliance and nail-biting excitement. In this analysis, we take a closer look at the season's standout moments and trends, giving you a glimpse into the captivating world of football.

With 20 teams and a whopping 613 players in the mix, the EPL truly showcased the best of the best. A total of 1399 goals and 105 penalties added to the drama on the field, keeping fans on the edge of their seats throughout the season.

One burning question on my mind was which position saw the most action in front of the goal. My Analysis revealed that Attacking midfielders, Wingers and forwards stole the spotlight, notching up a remarkable 491 goals between them. At the forefront of this goal-scoring was Liverpool's Mohamed Salah, whose 31 goals earned him the title of the league's top scorer.

But it wasn't all about individual brilliance. I also delved into the intriguing relationship between player positions and disciplinary actions. While I found a slight tendency for certain positions to receive fewer yellow cards, the link wasn't strong. On the other hand, defenders who graced the pitch more frequently found themselves in the referee's book more often, hinting at the physicality of their role.
In terms of disciplinary actions, my analysis revealed that the player with the most yellow cards was James Tarkowski, a defender from Burnley. This highlighted the physical nature of defending and the challenges players face in maintaining discipline on the field

Further examination led us to explore the ratio of goals to appearances, shedding light on the efficiency of players in front of goal. Aston Villa's Cameron Archer emerged as a standout performer in this regard, boasting a remarkable ratio of 2.0 goals per appearance, underlining his clinical finishing ability.
My analysis didn't stop there. I also zoomed in on how individual player contributions shaped their respective clubs' performances. Manchester City emerged as the powerhouse, racking up an impressive 146 goals. Meanwhile, Liverpool's Mohamed Salah continued to dazzle, leading his team's charge with his remarkable goal-scoring ability.
Here are the top 5 goal scorers of the season along with their team names:
1.	Mohamed Salah (Liverpool) - 31 goals
2.	Harry Kane (Tottenham Hotspur) - 27 goals
3.	Cristiano Ronaldo (Manchester United) - 24 goals
4.	Riyad Mahrez (Manchester City) - 24 goals
5.	James Maddison (Leicester City) - 18 goals


In my analysis I also shed light on the importance of player versatility, with those capable of playing multiple positions making more appearances on average. And let's not forget about Chelsea, the team awarded the most penalties, showcasing their attackers attacking flair and ability to draw fouls in the opposition penalty box during the season.

In essence, my analysis paints a vivid picture of the EPL 2021-22 season, offering insights into the magic of football. While individual brilliance certainly shone, it was the collective effort and strategic gameplay of every manager and their backroom staff that truly defined success on the football pitch.
